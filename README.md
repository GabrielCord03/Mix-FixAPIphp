# Spotify PHP API Project

This project is a simple application that connects a frontend interface with the Spotify API through a PHP backend. The architecture is organized into two main parts: the API and the frontend.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spotify-php-api-project
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies:**
   Navigate to the `api` directory and run:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure the Spotify API:**
   You will need to set up your Spotify API credentials. Create a configuration file or set environment variables as needed.

4. **Run the API:**
   You can use a local server like Apache or PHP's built-in server to run the API. For example:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

5. **Open the frontend:**
   Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser to access the application.

## Usage Guidelines

- The frontend communicates with the PHP API to fetch data from Spotify.
- Ensure that you have valid Spotify API credentials to make requests.
- Modify the `SpotifyService.php` file to add or change the methods for interacting with the Spotify API as needed.
